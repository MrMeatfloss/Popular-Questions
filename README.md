### How expensive is it to buy a saxophone including all the necessary materials/equipment?

A:  The cheapest saxophone you can get can go down to as cheap as $200 CAD, but it is definetely not recommended due to their poor conditions and lack of sustainibility in the long run. The lowest price you can get for a decent tenor saxophone should be at least $1200 CAD or higher, including all the necessary materials in order to start playing. Keep in mind that alto saxophones will be cheaper than the tenor saxophone and the baritone saxophone will be more expensive.

As for how expensive a saxophone can get, it can go up to $5000 CAD, or even 10k if it's in prestige edition/limited edition, where some of your favourite saxophone players may be using.

For beginners, I strongly recommend renting a saxophone first before buying one. See "Should I rent a saxophone or buy one" below for more info on renting vs buying.


### How much do expensive and cheap saxophones matter?

A: A expensive saxophone matters quite a lot compared to a cheap saxophone. The difference between a cheap and expensive saxophone is the quality of the material used, which can change not only the weight of a saxophone, but also the sound that your saxophone makes. A expensive saxophone is also more responsive with the buttons , as each press can feel like theres more weight into it, making it smoother to play. 

From my experience playing a decently priced saxophone in the $1000-2000 CAD range, some of the problems that I've had were the tightness of the buttons as they would sometimes be loosened, which made the sound of my saxophone unclear, making it more difficult to play.


### Should I buy a cheap or expensive saxophone?

A:For beginners, as long as you don't fall into the trap of buying extremely cheap saxophones, you should be fine. The only options that I would recommend/consider are saxophones that are at least in the $1000-2000 CAD range.

If I were to choose between a medium priced saxophone and a highly priced saxophone as my first option, I would choose the medium priced saxophone because if you start from the top, you will never get to experience/learn the differences between expensive and cheap saxophones.

### Should I rent a saxophone or buy one?

A: Beginners should definetly start with a rented saxophone because you never know if you will continue playing the saxophone in the future. Renting is also extremely cheap in the short term so you should definitely take advantage of that.

### Should I buy the saxophone online or in person?

A: Usually, it is better to buy in person because you get to see the saxophone in person and maybe, the store owner might even let you try it first. 

### Which saxophone brand should I get?

A: For beginners, especially students, Yamaha is for sure your best bet due to the fact that they are pretty cheap, produces good sound, and are in-tone. For saxophone reeds, I highly recommend Rico as they have a large variety of reeds which are consistent and high quality.


# Maintainance and Repairs

### How important is cleaning and maintaining your saxophone? How often should i clean my saxophone?

A: It is important to clean your saxophone after you are finished with playing because otherwise, some of the buttons may get sticky and the pads may then be unable to fit into the keys. This will make it more difficult to get a good sound out of your saxophone. Your saxophone should also be stored in a case when you are not playing.

### If there is an issue with my saxophone, how difficult will it be to fix the issue. Will repairs be expensive?

A: I highly recommend you to simply go see a repair shop instead of trying to fix it yourself and potentially breaking/damaging the instrument due to how complex it is to break the saxophone down. Saxophone repairs are pretty expensive, sitting at just over $500 CAD  to simply repad the instrument and clean it all up. Although it may be expensive, it is still worth it to bring the saxophone to a repair shop. 

The expensive pricing of repairing a saxophone can also be a lesson to always clean your saxophone if you do not want to waste $500, so take care of your instrument!
